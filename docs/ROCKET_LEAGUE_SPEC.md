# Car Ball - Game Spec

## Overview

A browser-based car soccer game inspired by Rocket League. Players control rocket-powered cars to hit a ball into the opponent's goal. Built with the ECS architecture, Rapier physics, and Three.js rendering.

**Name:** Car Ball

**Art Style:** Arcade / Low-poly

- Clean, readable visuals
- Stylized but not too cartoony
- Similar vibe to Rocket League but simpler geometry
- Neon/glow accents for boost trails, goal explosions
- Vibrant team colors (blue vs orange)

---

## Core Gameplay

### The Pitch

> Drive rocket-powered cars, hit a giant ball, score goals. Simple to learn, hard to master.

### Core Loop

1. Spawn in arena
2. Drive toward ball
3. Hit ball toward opponent's goal
4. Use boost for speed/aerials
5. Defend your goal
6. Score more goals than opponent
7. Win match

### Match Structure

- **Match duration:** 5 minutes (configurable)
- **Overtime:** Sudden death if tied (first goal wins)
- **Team sizes:** 1v1, 2v2, 3v3
- **Respawn:** 3 seconds after demolition or goal

### Movement Mechanics

#### Ground Movement

- Arcade-style car physics (not simulation)
- Drifting on sharp turns
- Powerslide with handbrake
- Can drive on walls and ceiling (magnetic grip)

#### Jumping

- **Single jump:** Instant upward impulse
- **Double jump:** Second impulse (must be within 1.5s of first)
- **Dodge:** Directional flip with ball hit power
  - Front flip: Forward momentum + ball hit
  - Side flip: Lateral movement
  - Back flip: Backward momentum
  - Diagonal: Combined

#### Boost

- **Capacity:** 100 units
- **Usage:** 33 units/second while boosting
- **Small pads:** +12 boost, respawn in 4s
- **Large pads (corners):** +100 boost (full), respawn in 10s
- **Start of match:** 33 boost

#### Aerials

- Use boost in air to fly
- Air roll for orientation
- Most advanced mechanic - skill ceiling

## Ball

### Physics

```
Radius: 1.0m (92 units in RL)
Mass: ~30 units
Restitution: 0.6 (bouncy)
Max speed: 60 m/s
Friction: Low

Gravity: Same as cars (simpler) or slightly less
```

### Ball-Car Interaction

- Ball hit force based on:
  - Car velocity at impact
  - Car orientation (nose hits harder)
  - Dodge state (dodging = power hit)
- Ball cam: Camera always faces ball (toggle)

---

## Arena

### Dimensions

```
Length: 100m (goal to goal)
Width: 70m
Height: 20m (ceiling)

Goal width: 8m
Goal height: 4m
Goal depth: 3m
```

### Layout

+--[====GOAL====]----------------[====GOAL====]---+
     Blue Team                     Orange Team
```

### Surfaces

- **Floor:** Standard friction
- **Walls:** Driveable (curved transition from floor)
- **Ceiling:** Driveable
- **Goals:** Ball enters = goal scored
- **Back wall:** Behind goals, ball bounces off

### Visual Style

**Arcade / Low-Poly** with neon accents:

- Simple geometry (low-poly cars, smooth arena)
- Bright, readable colors
- Glow effects on boost trails, ball, goals
- Clean floor with subtle grid texture
- Stadium lights for atmosphere
- Team colors: Blue (#3B82F6) vs Orange (#F97316)

## Game Modes

### MVP (Phase 1)

- **1v1 Local:** You vs AI or split screen
- **Free Play:** Practice mode, no timer

### Phase 2

- **1v1 Online:** Multiplayer
- **2v2 / 3v3:** Team modes

### Phase 3 (Stretch)

- **Ranked:** Matchmaking with skill rating
- **Custom Games:** Private lobbies
- **Training:** Specific mechanic drills

---

## Multiplayer Architecture

### Networking Model

```
Option A: Client-Server (Authoritative)
- Server runs physics
- Clients send inputs
- Server broadcasts state
- Pros: Anti-cheat, consistency
- Cons: Requires server, latency

Option B: Peer-to-Peer with Host
- One player is host (runs physics)
- Others send inputs to host
- Host broadcasts state
- Pros: Free, lower latency for host
- Cons: Host advantage, no host = game ends

Option C: Rollback Netcode
- Each client predicts locally
- Rollback on mismatch
- Pros: Feels responsive
- Cons: Complex, physics rollback is hard
```

**Recommendation:** Start with Option B (P2P with host) using WebRTC or Partykit. Upgrade to Option A if game gets popular.

### State Sync

```typescript
// Sync these every tick (60Hz ideal, 20Hz minimum)
interface GameState {
  tick: number
  ball: { position, velocity, angularVelocity }
  players: [{
    id: string
    position, rotation
    velocity, angularVelocity
    boost: number
    isJumping, isBoosting, isDodging
  }]
  score: { blue: number, orange: number }
  timeRemaining: number
}

// Send these from clients
interface PlayerInput {
  tick: number
  throttle: -1 | 0 | 1
  steer: -1 to 1
  jump: boolean
  boost: boolean
  airRoll: -1 | 0 | 1
}
```

### Latency Handling

- Input delay: 0-2 frames acceptable
- Interpolate remote players (buffer 2-3 states)
- Extrapolate on packet loss
- Ball prediction for local feel
